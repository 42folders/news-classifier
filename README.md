# An NLP learning journey

Documenting my foray into Natural Language Processing with Python here.
I'll compare the DistilBERT transformer model with a non-transformer model to see which performs better on a text classification task. 

The text sequences are from the Huffington Post news dataset, which has more than 12K records. So lack of training examples is not a limiting factor (except for the extremely small categories).
