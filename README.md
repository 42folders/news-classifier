# An NLP learning journey

Documenting my foray into Natural Language Processing with Python here. I'll train a simple text classifier for the classification of the Huffington Post news dataset. 

This dataset has more than 200K records -- lack of training examples is not a limiting factor. Even for the smallest categories, there are at least 1000 samples. However this is an extremely imbalanced dataset, which gives opportunities to practise techniques to correct for the imbalance. 

compare the DistilBERT transformer model with a non-transformer model to see which performs better on a text classification task.
