"Sunday Roundup This week brought multiple challenges to move from outrage to action. On Tuesday, the dash cam video of the violent arrest of Sandra Bland was released; authorities later said autopsy results suggested she had committed suicide while in jail. But many questions remain, including why, already this year, an estimated 651 people have been killed by police -- 172 of them African American, 142 unarmed. Less questionable is that our justice system is broken, and in ways that inescapably involve race. On Thursday there was yet another mass shooting, this time in Lafayette, Louisiana. The gunman, despite having a long criminal record, had legally obtained his weapon. Just hours before the shooting, President Obama had said the ""great frustration"" of his presidency was not being able to pass ""common-sense gun safety laws."" As we move into the election season, it's time to put both of these critical issues on the front burner. Neither will change until we demand it.",POLITICS

To call it a circus would be to insult the dignity, decorum and poise of the circus.

Meanwhile -- irony alert! -- Trump said former Mexican President Vincente Fox ""used a filthy, disgusting word"" and ""should be ashamed."" Even worse, the substance matched the atmosphere. After an extended debate on poll numbers, it was hard not to wonder how much better it would be if the candidates cared about meaningful data as much as poll data: like the new report that the seas are rising at their fastest rate in 28 centuries. Or that 22 million people would lose healthcare with Obamacare's repeal. Or that deporting 11 million people would cost an estimated $400 - $600 billion, take 20 years and lower real GDP by $1.6 trillion. But, of course, facts are for losers.",POLITICS

"Sunday Roundup This week saw the first conservative government reelected to a second term in the U.K. since Margaret Thatcher's. Returns showed David Cameron winning easily, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats losing big. But the other clear losers were the pollsters, along with anyone who believed their predictions of a virtual tie. Pollsters are not exactly on a roll. In March, polls wrongly showed a dead-heat in Israel between the Zionist Union party and Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud, which, in fact, won handily. And here at home, polls in the 2014 midterms overestimated Democrats in Senate races by four percent. As three new candidates -- Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson -- tossed their hats into the crowded presidential ring this week, it's a good time to remind ourselves about the folly of breathless poll-obsessed political coverage. It's the people, not the polls, that matter. And focusing on the horse race at the expense of debating real issues makes losers of us all.",POLITICS

But perhaps it sealed the deal for Speaker Paul Ryan, who, after hesitating, endorsed Trump, showing his principles to be worth as much as a Trump U real estate class. Rising to the occasion were Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, who declined to endorse Trump, and former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden, who described Trump's rhetoric as ""feeding"" ISIS's recruitment videos. And you don't have to be a genius to see Trump for who he is, but it doesn't hurt. He's ""a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator,"" said Stephen Hawking.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump postponed his Friday announcement of running mate Mike Pence because, according to campaign manager Paul Manafort, Trump ""reacted emotionally"" to the Nice attack. There were also reports that, as of late Thursday night, Trump was making calls to see if he could reverse his choice of Pence (a man who wrote that ""global warming is a myth,"" smoking ""doesn't kill"" and apparently doesn't believe in evolution). Uncertain and unsteady times call for steady and clear-eyed leadership -- not emotionally driven, ad hoc improvising and posturing.

"Why the 99 Percent Keeps Losing Our current political situation is unprecedented. The vast majority of Americans keep falling behind economically because of changes in society's ground rules, while the rich get even richer -- yet this situation doesn't translate into a winning politics. If anything, the right keeps gaining and the wealthy keep pulling away. How can this possibly be? In the face of all these assaults on the working and middle class, there are many movements but no Movement. The Occupy movement, which gave us the phrase, ""The One Percent,"" was too hung up on its own procedural purity to create a broad movement for economic justice. This vicious circle can be reversed, as it has been reversed at moments in the American past. As that noted political consultant Joe Hill put it, as they were taking him to the gallows, ""Don't mourn, organize.""",POLITICS

"Destressing the Holidays: Making a List, Checking It Twice Why does a season that's supposed to be about happiness and joy so often result in just the opposite? A survey by Consumer Reports found that 90 percent of Americans find at least one thing stressful about the holiday season (who are these 10 percent who feel no holiday stress?). Of course, it's possible that just having such expectations of the season to begin with, and then feeling the guilt at not meeting them, might be part of the problem. But whatever the reason, stress is what a lot of people will be unwrapping this year. Fortunately, much of it is returnable. So what follows are tips not only for holiday stress, but for the rest of the year as well. If you're in that 90 percent who's stressed out this week and next, this might be the list you should be checking twice. Your mind and body -- as well as your family -- will thank you.",WELLNESS
